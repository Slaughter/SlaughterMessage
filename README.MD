# Slaughter Message

A self destrusting encrypted message thing with a horribly uncreative name.

Made out of pure boredom and because I had a few hours to kill. I have not done a whole lot of testing(read: none) but it should work. I know  *very* little JS and I am not the most amazing at php. No amazing css because I aint about that life.
